# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.6] - 2025-06-06

### Added
- **Safe note deletion**: New note_delete tool provides safe deletion by moving files to a Trash/≈ömietnik directory instead of permanent deletion. Creates trash directory automatically and handles duplicate filenames by adding numbers.
- **Guide mode A/B/C choices**: Guide mode now provides clear A/B/C options at the end of responses to eliminate decision fatigue and create guided conversation flow. Users get actionable choices for exploring features, library content, and next steps with simple "Type A, B, or C to continue" prompts.
- **New compass emoji for link expansion**: The compass emoji üß≠ is now the primary symbol for link expansion, replacing the magnifying glass üîé. The old magnifying glass emoji is still supported for backward compatibility, so your existing setups will continue to work perfectly.
- **Analytics Mode**: New specialized mode for thorough pattern analysis and accountability conversations that examines 30 days of daily notes to provide data-driven insights about productivity, health, habits, and goal progress
- **Tool Call History in Saved Conversations**: Saved conversations now include information about which tools were used and their labels, making saved chats more complete and useful for reference without cluttering them with large tool results
- **Enhanced Guide Mode**: Comprehensive improvements to the Guide prebuilt mode including:
  - Always browse library index AND check user's actual vault content before making recommendations
  - Clear distinction between library templates/examples vs user's installed content
  - Never assumes library content is installed without checking user's vault first
  - Improved library tool descriptions to clarify they show remote templates, not user content
  - Better vault assessment using vault_find and note_read tools
  - Context limitations notice explaining Guide mode is for discovery/development, not personal reflection
  - Development and prototyping support for creating custom modes and tools
  - Manual references to comprehensive development documentation
  - Mode and tool validation capabilities with automatic quality checking
  - Learning persistence to avoid repeating concepts user already understands
- **Direct Setup Guidance**: Guide mode now focuses on helping users create their actual Life Navigator setup immediately rather than simulations, providing more authentic and immediately useful onboarding
- **Development Documentation**: New comprehensive guides for extending Life Navigator:
  - Mode Development Guide with templates, best practices, and troubleshooting
  - Tool Development Guide covering JavaScript tools, security, and API integration
  - Updated library index with development resources and Analytics mode
- **Mobile tool expansion**: Long press on tool blocks now expands/collapses them on mobile devices, providing the mobile equivalent of desktop's shift+click functionality

### Fixed
- **System prompt view with unresolved links**: Fixed issue where clicking "View system prompt" would fail silently when the mode contained unresolved links (like `[[Backlog2]] üß≠`). Now shows a clear error message explaining which links couldn't be found and how to fix them.
- **Input state persistence**: Input text and attached images now clear automatically when starting a new chat or switching between conversations, preventing confusion and ensuring a clean slate for each conversation.

### Enhanced
- **Guide Mode Intelligence**: Now emphasizes library exploration, provides development guidance, and offers clear A/B/C choices for next steps
- **Library Organization**: Updated index with development documentation and Analytics mode for better discoverability

## [0.10.4] - 2025-06-05

### Fixed
- **Message validation cutting off conversations**: Fixed critical issue where the last assistant and user messages weren't being sent to AI when conversations contained incomplete tool calls or thinking blocks earlier in the conversation. Now properly skips problematic messages while preserving valid messages at the end of conversations.
- **Chat history saving**: Fixed issue where conversation history wasn't saving on Mac due to missing conversations directory. The plugin now automatically creates the required directory on startup.

### Enhanced
- **Improved note editing tool**: Fixed multiline text replacement issues by adding smart text normalization that handles different line endings, whitespace, and formatting. Now shows edited content with ¬±3 lines of context (marking edited lines with ‚óè) and creates precise navigation targets that highlight exactly the edited lines.
- **Better find tool feedback**: The find tool now shows specific counts like "Found 5 items in root" instead of the generic "Found content in root"

### Changed
- **Library tool renamed**: The library content viewing tool is now called "library_read" instead of "library_view" and shows specific file paths in completion messages, making it consistent with the document reading tool
- **Mode name change**: Life Navigator mode is now called "Guide" to better reflect its purpose as a helpful assistant that guides users through their tasks and goals


### Fixed
- **Improved comment indentation**: Task tools now consistently use proper comment indentation.

## [0.10.2] - 2025-06-05

### Added
- **Smart text selection**: Easily share any text you've highlighted with the AI using the new `[[ln-currently-selected-text]] üîé` link. Perfect for editing specific parts of text.
- **Rapid voice recording**: You can now record your next message even if ai is responding to your previous message.
- **Cleaner tool displays**: Multi-line text in AI tools now shows with proper formatting instead of cramped single lines, making everything easier to read.

### Fixed
- **Smarter chat history**: Opening old conversations no longer automatically saves them or moves them to the top unless you actually make changes. Your history stays organized exactly how you left it.
- **Better reading experience**: When you scroll up to read previous messages, the chat stays put instead of annoyingly jumping to the bottom every few seconds.
- **Remembers your preferences**: Your selected mode now stays active when you restart the app - no more having to reselect your favorite mode every time.
- **Perfect conversation flow**: Switching between conversations or starting new messages now works smoothly without any conflicts or interruptions.

## [0.10.1] - 2025-06-04

## [0.7.4] - 2025-05-26

### Changed
- **English Starter Kit Recreated**: Completely recreated the English starter kit by translating from the Polish version. All content has been thoroughly translated including filenames, with key translations like "Ziomal" ‚Üí "Bro" and "O mnie" ‚Üí "About Me". The English starter kit now matches the comprehensive structure and content of the Polish version.

### Fixed

## [0.6.6] - 2025-05-22


## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Todo editing display**: Fixed issue where todo labels showed the original text instead of the new text after editing, and success messages displayed template placeholders instead of actual values


### Added
- **Tool parameter validation**: Tools now validate all parameters against their JSON schema before execution, providing clear error messages to the AI when parameters are invalid or missing. This prevents tools from running with incorrect data and improves error feedback.

### Enhanced
- **Schema-based parameter validation**: All tool parameters are now validated for type correctness, required fields, string length constraints, number ranges, array sizes, enum values, and nested object properties. Invalid parameters are caught early with descriptive error messages.
- **Translation cleanup script improvements**: The script now explicitly detects and warns about dynamic translation keys that break static analysis, provides clear step-by-step instructions for fixing issues, and gives specific guidance on what to do after adding new translation keys

### Changed
- **Mode attributes now use human-readable names**: Changed from `ln_` prefixes to clear names (`ln_description` ‚Üí `description`, `ln_icon` ‚Üí `icon`, etc.) for better readability and following Obsidian naming conventions
- **Static error messages for old format modes**: Replaced dynamic error messages with static ones to improve translation management and prevent runtime issues
- **Validation messages now properly translated**: Tool and mode validation completion messages show different status based on results (success, warnings, errors) with proper translations instead of hard-coded English text

### Added
- **Old format detection with guided fix**: When old `ln_` format is detected in mode files, a static error message is displayed with a button that automatically switches to guide mode and asks for help fixing the mode file formatting

### Fixed
- **Documentation examples updated**: Fixed Tool Development Guide and Tool Creator mode examples that were using outdated `ln_` format attributes, which could mislead AI when creating modes and tools

### Added
- **Comprehensive validation system**: New centralized validation for both mode and tool files that detects various issues including old format, missing fields, invalid values, and security concerns. Validation runs automatically when files are loaded and provides detailed error reports.
- **Contextual fix buttons**: Smart fix buttons appear throughout the UI when validation issues are detected:
  - Empty chat shows fix button for the current mode if it has validation issues
  - Mode dropdown shows fix button for the currently selected mode if it has issues (positioned as last option before mode switching section)  
  - Guide mode shows fix buttons for modes and tools when issues exist
  - Settings tool section shows fix button when tool validation errors are found
  - All buttons automatically switch to Guide mode and send appropriate help messages
- **Enhanced validation tool**: Updated mode validator tool now supports both modes and tools with comprehensive validation using the centralized system, providing detailed reports with specific error types and severity levels.

### Fixed
- **Note editing tool parameter consistency**: Unified all note editing operations to use a single 'content' parameter instead of having separate 'content' and 'replacement_text' parameters. This makes the API more consistent and intuitive - all operations now use 'content' for the text they work with.

### Enhanced
- **Icon validation for modes and tools**: All mode and tool icons are now validated to ensure they are valid Lucide icons available in Obsidian. The validation system checks icon names and provides helpful error messages with links to the Lucide icon library when invalid icons are used.
- **Tool attributes now use human-readable names**: Updated all tool parameters from `ln_` prefixes to clear names (`ln_description` ‚Üí `description`, `ln_icon` ‚Üí `icon`, `ln_version` ‚Üí `version`, `ln_enabled` ‚Üí `enabled`) for consistency with mode format and better readability. All library tools and documentation updated to use new format while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Backward compatibility**: Mode and tool files using old `ln_` format continue to work while validation system detects and reports the format issues for user awareness.
- **Validation tracking**: Store now tracks invalid modes and tools separately, enabling targeted fix suggestions and better user experience.
- **Improved internationalization**: Validation messages now use separate translation keys for different plural forms instead of handling pluralization in code, providing better language support and maintaining proper grammar rules for each language.
- **Detailed validation error messages**: Validation fix buttons now show actual file paths instead of just counts, making it easier to identify which specific files need attention. Messages display up to 5 file paths and indicate when there are more files with issues.
- **Mode validator tool translations**: Fixed hardcoded English text in the mode validator tool to use proper translation keys, ensuring all tool labels and status messages display correctly in the user's selected language.
- **Enhanced error message interface**: Error messages now display clean icon-based buttons (retry and help) using the same styling as other interface elements, improving visual consistency and user experience
- **Improved error message styling**: Updated error message buttons to use consistent clickable-icon styling with proper icons (life-buoy for help, rotate-ccw for retry) instead of text-based buttons

### Added
- **Retry button on all assistant messages**: Every assistant message now has a retry button that allows you to retry from that point in the conversation. The retry removes the selected message and all messages after it, then generates a new response.

### Fixed
- **API error handling**: Fixed critical error where error messages were being sent to the Anthropic API with an invalid 'error_message' content type. Error messages are now converted to regular text blocks so the AI can be aware of errors and provide better assistance.
- **Error message context**: Error messages now include the mode name when asking for help, providing better context to the AI about which mode is experiencing the problem.
- **Error messages with fix buttons**: When link expansion errors occur (like missing `[[Backlog2]] üß≠` links), they now appear as styled error messages in the chat instead of popup notifications. Error messages include a "Fix with Guide" button that automatically switches to Guide mode and sends an appropriate help request.

### Enhanced
- **Shared file monitoring**: Improved performance by creating a reusable file watcher utility that both modes and tools systems now use with debouncing to prevent excessive reloading during rapid file changes. The utility uses a clean tag-based approach similar to the existing `hasModeTag` function, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior across both systems.

### Fixed
- **Task editing navigation**: Fixed issue where editing a task would cause the entire file to be selected instead of just the modified task. The problem was that navigation targets were calculated using the old document structure instead of the updated one after task modification.


### Added
- **Expand Life Navigator links in note reading**: The note_read tool now supports an optional `expand_links` parameter that expands special Life Navigator links (like `[[ln-day-note-(-1)]] üß≠`, `[[ln-current-date-and-time]] üß≠`) when reading files. This allows AI to access dynamic content when analyzing notes.

### Changed
- **In-Chat Error Handling:**
Replace popup notifications with in-chat error messages for better user experience and context preservation. When API key errors, authentication failures, or other system errors occur, display them as special error messages directly in the chat interface instead of disruptive popup notifications. This would keep error information accessible within the conversation context, allow users to reference errors while troubleshooting, and maintain a smoother conversational flow without interrupting the user's workflow.
