# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Model Selection for Modes**: Added `ln_model` attribute to Life Navigator modes allowing users to specify which Anthropic model to use for each mode
- **YouTube Transcript Download Tool**: New `download_youtube_transcript` tool that downloads transcripts from YouTube videos and saves them to Obsidian files. Supports multiple languages, timestamp inclusion/exclusion, and handles various YouTube URL formats. Includes automatic fallback to default language if specified language is unavailable.
- **HTML Comment Filtering**: System prompts now automatically filter out top-level HTML comments while preserving them in code blocks. This prevents deleted task comments and other HTML annotations from being included in AI context while maintaining code examples intact.

### Fixed
- **Mode List Update on Deletion**: Fixed issue where the mode list in the dropdown would not update when deleting starter pack or single mode files. The mode list now properly refreshes when mode files are deleted, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the actual available modes.
- **Message Editing Index Bug**: Fixed bug where "Can only edit user messages" error would sometimes appear when editing user messages. The issue was caused by a mismatch between filtered conversation indices (used for display) and original conversation indices (used for editing). Now correctly maps filtered indices to original conversation indices.

## [0.7.4] - 2025-05-26

### Changed
- **English Starter Kit Recreated**: Completely recreated the English starter kit by translating from the Polish version. All content has been thoroughly translated including filenames, with key translations like "Ziomal" → "Bro" and "O mnie" → "About Me". The English starter kit now matches the comprehensive structure and content of the Polish version.

### Fixed
- **Chat Autoscroll During Agent Response**: Fixed autoscroll functionality to properly scroll to bottom while agent is typing/streaming responses, ensuring users can always see the latest content being generated. Optimized to prevent double-scrolling by using MutationObserver during streaming and conversation-based scrolling otherwise.
- **Starter Kit Directory Creation**: Fixed starter kit creation to handle existing directories by automatically generating unique names (e.g., "Starter Kit v0.4 2", "Starter Kit v0.4 3") instead of failing when a directory already exists

## [0.6.13] - 2025-05-25

### Added
- **Edit Todo Tool**: New `edit_todo` tool allows editing existing todo items
- **Remove Todo Tool**: New `remove_todo` tool for removing todo items without deletion
- **Time Parameter for Abandon Todo**: Added `time` parameter to abandon-todo tool for consistent time tracking across all task operations
- **Circular Image Thumbnails**: Improved attached image visualization with compact circular thumbnails and positioned remove buttons for a cleaner, more modern interface

### Changed
- **Relaxed todo format**: All tools now don't enforce emojis etc
- **Edit Todo Tool Parameters**: Simplified edit_todo tool parameter structure by flattening nested objects to direct parameters for better AI model compatibility
- **Enhanced Time Markers**: Both check-todo and abandon-todo tools now use translatable time markers ("completed at XX:XX" / "abandoned at XX:XX") instead of simple timestamps

### Fixed
- **Voice Instructions**: Fixed voice instructions in Bro/Ziomal and Assistant/Asystentka modes with proper personality-matching instructions
- **New Mode Creation**: Fixed new modes using generic translated voice instructions instead of proper detailed DEFAULT_VOICE_INSTRUCTIONS
- **Task Search in Tools**: Improved task search precision by using exact text matching instead of fuzzy matching
- **Multiple Task Moving Order**: Fixed issue where multiple tasks being moved would be inserted in reverse order instead of preserving the parameter order
- **Abandon todo now moves task to the beginning of the note**: Abandoned tasks are now moved to the beginning of the note for better visibility, same as completed tasks
- **Enhanced moveTaskToCurrentSpot function**: Expanded positioning support to handle 'beginning', 'end', and 'after' positions, unifying task movement logic across all tools
- **Translation of removed task comments**: Fixed "Removed task" text in HTML comments to be properly translated in Polish and other languages
- **Mobile Waveform Visualization**: Fixed flat waveform issue on mobile devices by improving AudioContext state management, adding automatic recovery mechanisms, handling mobile browser audio interruptions, and implementing better error detection and recovery
- **Voice Recording with Images**: Fixed issue where the microphone button would disappear when attaching images - users can now record voice notes even when images are attached
- **Recording Input Behavior**: Input field and placeholder are now completely hidden during voice recording and transcription, image preview area is hidden during transcription, and image editing (paste, attach, remove) is disabled during recording and transcription
- **Mobile Usage Example Pills**: Improved styling and visibility of usage example buttons (pills) on mobile devices with better contrast, touch-friendly sizing, proper Obsidian theme integration, and enhanced accessibility features
- **Transcription Cancellation UX**: Improved transcription cancellation by allowing users to click the spinner button itself to cancel transcription, removing the need for a separate X button during transcription
- **Mobile Message Action Buttons**: Message action buttons (edit, copy, speak) are now always visible on mobile devices instead of requiring hover interaction


## [0.6.12] - 2025-05-23

### Changed
- Showing mic and send button at the same time

### Fixed
- Styling of main chat
- Better view of pills
- Better editing of messages
- Less invasive thinking indicator
- Removing empty messages so chat can continue
- Skipping current mode in handover options

## [0.6.11] - 2025-05-23

### Added
- **Tool Filtering for Modes**: New configuration options for controlling which tools are available in each mode
  - Added `ln_tools_allowed` and `ln_tools_disallowed` fields to mode configuration
  - Supports simple wildcard patterns (e.g., `*todo*`, `create_*`, `*document`)
  - Disallowed patterns take precedence over allowed patterns
  - Default behavior allows all tools (`["*"]`) for backward compatibility
  - Updated starter kit modes with example tool filtering configurations
- **Handover Mode Tool**: New AI tool that allows changing the active mode during conversations
  - Enables AI to switch between different personalities, contexts, or specialized modes

### Changed
- **Enhanced speaker button** Enhanced speaker button with three distinct states: default, generating speech (spinner), and playing (pause button)
- **Improved task insertion logic**: Tasks are now inserted after the task preceding the first uncompleted one, preserving any text/comments between them. This ensures that related content stays with their associated tasks while maintaining logical flow.
- **Improved abandon todo visibility**: Abandoned tasks are now moved to the beginning of the note for better visibility, same as completed tasks
change: enforce thinking in claude, as it's needed for handover to work

### Fixed
- **Fixed multi-line comment indentation**: When todos are checked off or completed with multi-line comments, all lines are now properly indented with 4 spaces instead of only the first line

  - Fixed pluralization logic for tasks count in Polish language
  - Improved translation system to better handle numbered items
  - Fixed "Oznaczanie zadania 0 zadania" issue by removing task count in in-progress messages
