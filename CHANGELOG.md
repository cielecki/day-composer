# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.3] - 2025-06-05

### Fixed
- **Message validation cutting off conversations**: Fixed critical issue where the last assistant and user messages weren't being sent to AI when conversations contained incomplete tool calls or thinking blocks earlier in the conversation. Now properly skips problematic messages while preserving valid messages at the end of conversations.
- **Chat history saving**: Fixed issue where conversation history wasn't saving on Mac due to missing conversations directory. The plugin now automatically creates the required directory on startup.

### Enhanced
- **Improved note editing tool**: Fixed multiline text replacement issues by adding smart text normalization that handles different line endings, whitespace, and formatting. Now shows edited content with ¬±3 lines of context (marking edited lines with ‚óè) and creates precise navigation targets that highlight exactly the edited lines.
- **Better find tool feedback**: The find tool now shows specific counts like "Found 5 items in root" instead of the generic "Found content in root"

### Changed
- **Library tool renamed**: The library content viewing tool is now called "library_read" instead of "library_view" and shows specific file paths in completion messages, making it consistent with the document reading tool
- **Mode name change**: Life Navigator mode is now called "Guide" to better reflect its purpose as a helpful assistant that guides users through their tasks and goals


### Fixed
- **Improved comment indentation**: Task tools now consistently use proper comment indentation.

## [0.10.2] - 2025-06-05

### Added
- **Smart text selection**: Easily share any text you've highlighted with the AI using the new `[[ln-currently-selected-text]] üîé` link. Perfect for editing specific parts of text.
- **Rapid voice recording**: You can now record your next message even if ai is responding to your previous message.
- **Cleaner tool displays**: Multi-line text in AI tools now shows with proper formatting instead of cramped single lines, making everything easier to read.

### Fixed
- **Smarter chat history**: Opening old conversations no longer automatically saves them or moves them to the top unless you actually make changes. Your history stays organized exactly how you left it.
- **Better reading experience**: When you scroll up to read previous messages, the chat stays put instead of annoyingly jumping to the bottom every few seconds.
- **Remembers your preferences**: Your selected mode now stays active when you restart the app - no more having to reselect your favorite mode every time.
- **Perfect conversation flow**: Switching between conversations or starting new messages now works smoothly without any conflicts or interruptions.

## [0.10.1] - 2025-06-04

### Fixed
