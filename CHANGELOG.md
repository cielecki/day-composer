## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.3] - 2025-06-02

### Added
- **Audio Pause/Resume and Caching**: Enhanced audio controls with true pause/resume functionality and intelligent caching. Audio can be paused and resumed from the exact same position, not just stopped and restarted. Generated audio is cached within components for instant playback on repeated requests, improving performance and reducing API calls. Separate play/pause and stop buttons provide better control over audio playback. Cache uses legacy TTS for reliable audio generation and consistent results. Stop button remains active when audio is paused and resets everything back to the initial state (speaker icon ready to start from beginning). Fixed race condition where stopping audio generation would still play audio when generation completed in background. Main input area properly shows stop button when audio is paused instead of send button.

### Fixed
- **Mobile Highlighting & Scroll Positioning**: Enhanced text highlighting system for mobile devices, especially iOS. Replaced unreliable selection-based highlighting with robust CodeMirror decorations, added mobile-specific CSS with hardware acceleration, implemented iOS-specific focus handling, added visual pulse animation for better visibility on touch devices, and **fixed scroll positioning to ensure highlighted text appears properly on screen**. The system now uses proper `EditorView.scrollIntoView()` with device-optimized positioning (top positioning on mobile, center on desktop) and includes fallback visibility checks.
- **Polish Translation Completeness**: Fixed missing Polish translations for task unchecking and other tool actions. All tool action text (create completed todo, handover mode, read document, abandon todo, add todo) now properly displays in Polish instead of showing English text when Polish is selected as the language.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-06-01

### Added

- **Vault Exploration Tools**: Two new tools help AI browse your vault structure and find tagged files. AI can now navigate directories and locate content by tags more effectively.
- **Automatic Update Notifications**: Get notified when new plugin versions are available.
- **Daily Note Range Support**: Use `[[ln-day-note-(start:end)]] ðŸ”Ž` to reference multiple daily notes at once. Example: `[[ln-day-note-(-6:0)]] ðŸ”Ž` shows the last 7 days.
- **Real-Time Progress Updates**: Long-running operations like deep research now show live progress instead of making you wait with no feedback.
- **Auto-Send During Audio Playback**: When you finish recording while audio is playing, it automatically stops the audio and sends your message.
- **OpenAI Setup Memory**: Skip OpenAI configuration once and won't be asked again until you reset the tutorial.
- **Deep Research Tool**: Comprehensive web research using Firecrawl. Searches multiple sources and creates detailed reports with citations. Requires Firecrawl API key.
- **Enhanced Settings Page**: New action buttons for checking updates, creating starter kits, resetting tutorial, and viewing documentation.
- **Guided Setup Flow**: Step-by-step onboarding with separate screens for language selection, starter kit creation, and API key configuration.
- **GPT-4o Image Generation Tool**: Create high-quality images using OpenAI's latest model. Images are saved directly to your vault.
- **Clickable Tool Calls**: Click on tool call blocks in chat to navigate directly to relevant files and locations.
- **Model Selection for Modes**: Choose which Anthropic model each mode uses via the `ln_model` attribute.
- **YouTube Transcript Downloads**: Download transcripts from YouTube videos and save them as Obsidian files. Supports multiple languages and timestamp options.
- **Improved File Handling**: Automatic unique filename generation prevents overwrite errors (e.g., "research.md", "research 2.md").
- **Streaming Text-to-Speech**: Smooth, low-latency audio playback with intelligent text chunking and predictive buffering.
- **Mobile Message Editing**: Edit messages using the main input area instead of cramped inline editing. Much better experience on phones and tablets.
- **Conversation History**: Save, search, and revisit past conversations. Edit titles, add tags, and continue previous chats seamlessly.
- **AI Context Optimization**: Improved AI context handling by removing HTML comments from context data to prevent instructional information from skewing AI responses.

### Changed
- **Updated User Guide**: Comprehensive documentation for the new setup process and features.
- **Voice Recording Enhancement**: Add voice to existing text messages - transcription appends to current content.

### Fixed
- **Windows Starter Kit**: Fixed "folder already exists" error on Windows systems.
- **Thinking Block Issues**: Resolved animation and API errors when stopping mid-thinking.
- **Translation Completeness**: All tool messages now properly translated instead of showing English text.
- **HTML Comment Tasks**: Fixed bug where commented-out tasks were incorrectly parsed as real tasks.
- **Incomplete Tool Calls**: Robust handling when stopping generation during tool usage prevents API errors.
- **Stop Button for Long-Running Tools**: Fixed stop button not working during tool execution for deep research and image generation. Tools now properly handle abort signals and can be cancelled while running external API operations.


## [0.7.4] - 2025-05-26

### Changed
- **English Starter Kit Recreated**: Completely recreated the English starter kit by translating from the Polish version. All content has been thoroughly translated including filenames, with key translations like "Ziomal" â†’ "Bro" and "O mnie" â†’ "About Me". The English starter kit now matches the comprehensive structure and content of the Polish version.

### Fixed
- **Chat Autoscroll During Agent Response**: Fixed autoscroll functionality to properly scroll to bottom while agent is typing/streaming responses, ensuring users can always see the latest content being generated. Optimized to prevent double-scrolling by using MutationObserver during streaming and conversation-based scrolling otherwise.
- **Starter Kit Directory Creation**: Fixed starter kit creation to handle existing directories by automatically generating unique names (e.g., "Starter Kit v0.4 2", "Starter Kit v0.4 3") instead of failing when a directory already exists

## [0.6.13] - 2025-05-25

### Added
- **Edit Todo Tool**: New `edit_todo` tool allows editing existing todo items
- **Remove Todo Tool**: New `remove_todo` tool for removing todo items without deletion
- **Time Parameter for Abandon Todo**: Added `time` parameter to abandon-todo tool for consistent time tracking across all task operations
- **Circular Image Thumbnails**: Improved attached image visualization with compact circular thumbnails and positioned remove buttons for a cleaner, more modern interface

### Changed
- **Relaxed todo format**: All tools now don't enforce emojis etc
- **Edit Todo Tool Parameters**: Simplified edit_todo tool parameter structure by flattening nested objects to direct parameters for better AI model compatibility
- **Enhanced Time Markers**: Both check-todo and abandon-todo tools now use translatable time markers ("completed at XX:XX" / "abandoned at XX:XX") instead of simple timestamps

### Fixed
- **Voice Instructions**: Fixed voice instructions in Bro/Ziomal and Assistant/Asystentka modes with proper personality-matching instructions
- **New Mode Creation**: Fixed new modes using generic translated voice instructions instead of proper detailed DEFAULT_VOICE_INSTRUCTIONS
- **Task Search in Tools**: Improved task search precision by using exact text matching instead of fuzzy matching
- **Multiple Task Moving Order**: Fixed issue where multiple tasks being moved would be inserted in reverse order instead of preserving the parameter order
- **Abandon todo now moves task to the beginning of the note**: Abandoned tasks are now moved to the beginning of the note for better visibility, same as completed tasks

- **Translation of removed task comments**: Fixed "Removed task" text in HTML comments to be properly translated in Polish and other languages
- **Mobile Waveform Visualization**: Fixed flat waveform issue on mobile devices by improving AudioContext state management, adding automatic recovery mechanisms, handling mobile browser audio interruptions, and implementing better error detection and recovery
- **Voice Recording with Images**: Fixed issue where the microphone button would disappear when attaching images - users can now record voice notes even when images are attached
- **Recording Input Behavior**: Input field and placeholder are now completely hidden during voice recording and transcription, image preview area is hidden during transcription, and image editing (paste, attach, remove) is disabled during recording and transcription
- **Mobile Usage Example Pills**: Improved styling and visibility of usage example buttons (pills) on mobile devices with better contrast, touch-friendly sizing, proper Obsidian theme integration, and enhanced accessibility features
