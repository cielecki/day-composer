# Life Navigator - Roadmap

This document outlines potential future features and improvements for the Life Navigator plugin, based on user feedback and development ideas.

## Accepted/Implemented Ideas

See [TODO.md](../TODO.md) for accepted ideas.




## Floating Ideas


**Feedback System:**
Implement an in-app feedback system that allows users to:
- Submit feedback directly from the plugin interface
- Access documentation and community resources
- Report bugs or suggest features
- View the project's GitHub repository and documentation links

This will improve user experience by providing clear channels for feedback and support while making it easier for users to find help and resources.

**Documentation and Resources:**
Add a dedicated section in the plugin interface that provides:
- Links to official documentation
- GitHub repository access
- Community forums/discussions
- Quick start guides
- Video tutorials
- FAQ section

**Parallel Conversations:**
Implement support for multiple concurrent conversation windows, allowing users to maintain separate contexts and modes simultaneously. Each window would maintain its own state , enabling more efficient multitasking and context switching.


**Mode Switch Button Relocation:**
Move the mode switching button closer to the text input area for improved accessibility and faster mode changes during conversations. This will enhance the user experience by reducing the distance users need to move their cursor to switch modes.


**Mode Settings Editor:**
Create a comprehensive mode settings editor that allows users to configure all mode parameters through a user-friendly interface.

**Gemini Model Support and Model Selection:**
Add support for Gemini model from Google, and add a model selection option from the mode settings.

**Task List Tool:**
Re-implement a function to display the list of tasks as a tool call, accessible by the user.

**Weather Fetching Tool:**
Implement a tool to fetch and display weather information.

**Fire and forget chat workflow:**
Rethink the concept of creating a new chat for each voice message without automatically switching to it.

**Google Calendar Integration:**
Create a system to extract calendar information about upcoming events (today plus next 7 days) so the system can include this data in daily tasks.

**Endless Chat Interface:**
Implement an endless chat window in Obsidian with a recent messages view that includes truncated context and a "load previous messages" option similar to Cursor's interface. This would provide a more seamless chat experience with better context management.

**Audio Feedback System:**
Add audio signals/sounds to Life Navigator for various actions (task completion, end of speech, start of transcription processing) to provide better user feedback and interaction cues.

**Proactive Agent Notifications:**
Investigate the possibility of an agent that activates based on cron jobs or random events and sends notifications to the user (e.g., mobile notification, SMS). **This is only possible via external app.**

**Passive Listening Agent:**
Explore the ability to enter a voice-activated mode where the system waits for a wake phrase like "Hi Navigator" to start interacting. **This is only possible via external app.**


## General Notes

*   This roadmap is a living document and priorities may shift based on user feedback and development capacity.
*   Suggestions and contributions are welcome via the plugin's GitHub repository.
