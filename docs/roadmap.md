# Life Navigator - Roadmap

This document outlines potential future features and improvements for the Life Navigator plugin, based on user feedback and development ideas.

## Accepted/Implemented Ideas

See [TODO.md](../TODO.md) for accepted ideas.

## Floating Ideas

**Prompt Caching for Anthropic:**
Implement prompt caching to make conversations faster and more cost-effective by storing frequently used context and reducing repetitive processing. This would improve response times and create a smoother conversational experience for users.

**Local AI Model Support (Desktop Only):**
Add support for locally hosted AI models through LMStudio or Ollama integration as an optional feature for desktop users. This would enable offline functionality and provide enhanced privacy by processing personal and sensitive data locally rather than in the cloud. The plugin will automatically detect if running on mobile and disable this feature. Desktop users would benefit from greater control over their data while maintaining the core functionality of Life Navigator.

**Thinking Blocks Control:**
Research and implement enabling/disabling thinking blocks in Life Navigator - check if Anthropic will accept removal of thinking blocks.

**Boomerang Tasks:**
Implement a framework for handling tasks that "boomerang" back to the user on a framework like agents 2.0.

**Feedback System:**
Implement an in-app feedback system that allows users to:
- Submit feedback directly from the plugin interface
- Access documentation and community resources
- Report bugs or suggest features
- View the project's GitHub repository and documentation links

This will improve user experience by providing clear channels for feedback and support while making it easier for users to find help and resources.

**Documentation and Resources:**
Add a dedicated section in the plugin interface that provides:
- Links to official documentation
- GitHub repository access
- Community forums/discussions
- Quick start guides
- Video tutorials
- FAQ section

**Parallel Conversations:**
Implement support for multiple concurrent conversation windows, allowing users to maintain separate contexts and modes simultaneously. Each window would maintain its own state , enabling more efficient multitasking and context switching.


**Mode Switch Button Relocation:**
Move the mode switching button closer to the text input area for improved accessibility and faster mode changes during conversations. This will enhance the user experience by reducing the distance users need to move their cursor to switch modes.

**Flat Design Input Buttons:**
Evaluate transitioning to a flat design approach for input buttons and interface elements to create a more modern, streamlined visual experience. This would involve reviewing the current button styling and potentially adopting a minimalist design approach that reduces visual clutter while maintaining functionality.

**Mode Settings Editor:**
Create a comprehensive mode settings editor that allows users to configure all mode parameters through a user-friendly interface.

**Tool Management for Modes with Tag-Based Organization:**
Implement a tool management system for modes based on tags with a dedicated UI interface for editing modes. Prebuilt modes would have read-only interfaces, while custom modes could be fully editable. This interface should allow users to edit all mode settings including tool configurations, permissions, and parameters through an intuitive visual editor.

**Gemini Model Support and Model Selection:**
Add support for Gemini model from Google, and add a model selection option from the mode settings.

**Task List Tool:**
Re-implement a function to display the list of tasks as a tool call, accessible by the user.

**Fuzzy Search for Tasks:**
Implement fuzzy search functionality for task operations in Life Navigator to handle cases where exact task text matching fails. When a user tries to check off a task and the text doesn't match exactly, the system should suggest potential matches using text similarity algorithms, keyword matching, and edit distance calculations. This would solve the common problem where users get "task not found" errors when the text doesn't match 100%, instead providing helpful suggestions of similar tasks to choose from.

**Weather Fetching Tool:**
Implement a tool to fetch and display weather information.

**Fire and forget chat workflow:**
Rethink the concept of creating a new chat for each voice message without automatically switching to it.

**Google Calendar Integration:**
Create a system to extract calendar information about upcoming events (today plus next 7 days) so the system can include this data in daily tasks.

**Proper Mature User Defined Calendar Tool:**
Implement a comprehensive calendar tool that allows users to create, manage, and interact with their own calendar events directly within Life Navigator. This would provide full calendar functionality including event creation, editing, scheduling, and integration with daily task planning workflows.

**Endless Chat Interface:**
Implement an endless chat window in Obsidian with a recent messages view that includes truncated context and a "load previous messages" option similar to Cursor's interface. This would provide a more seamless chat experience with better context management.

**Audio Feedback System:**
Add audio signals/sounds to Life Navigator for various actions (task completion, end of speech, start of transcription processing) to provide better user feedback and interaction cues.

**Streaming Audio Playback:**
Rework the audio system to enable streaming speech playback that starts before message generation is complete. This would provide a more responsive and natural conversation experience by allowing users to hear the AI's response as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the entire message to be completed before audio playback begins.

**Proactive Agent Notifications:**
Investigate the possibility of an agent that activates based on cron jobs or random events and sends notifications to the user (e.g., mobile notification, SMS). **This is only possible via external app.**

**Passive Listening Agent:**
Explore the ability to enter a voice-activated mode where the system waits for a wake phrase like "Hi Navigator" to start interacting. **This is only possible via external app.**

**Todo Tools Support for Better Rich Text Format of Daily Notes:**
Maybe todo tools should support better a rich text format of the entire daily note? maybe they should be less rigid?

**Link Expansion to Tool Call Migration:**
Consider migrating certain link expansion functionality to tool calls for better consistency and flexibility:
- Convert `ln-day-note` from link expansion to tool calls
- Convert `ln-currently-open-file` and `ln-currently-selected-text` from link expansion to tool calls
- Potentially add support for calling any tool calls through link format (e.g., `[[tool-name]] ðŸ§­`)
This would provide more structured access to dynamic content, better error handling, and align with the existing tool architecture while potentially maintaining backward compatibility and expanding link format capabilities to all tools.

**Automatic Update Notifications:**
Implement periodic scanning for plugin updates with a hovering dialog that displays "update available" notifications. This would improve user experience by keeping users informed about new versions. Investigation needed to determine if this is feasible within Obsidian's plugin architecture and API limitations.

**Update Check Tool:**
Implement a tool that allows users to check for plugin updates directly through the Life Navigator chat interface, providing an alternative to navigating through Obsidian's settings. This would offer users a convenient way to check for updates on-demand during their workflow without leaving the conversation context.

**File Attachment Support:**
Add support for file attachments (not just images) in Life Navigator chat with automatic PDF to text conversion and drag & drop functionality from both file system and internally from Obsidian. This would allow users to seamlessly work with various document types and reference materials directly within their conversations.

**Enhanced Web Content Tools:**
Improve the url-downloader tool to convert results to markdown format and make it highly resilient to various schemes of providing content from URLs. Additionally, implement a basic Google search tool to allow users to search the web directly from Life Navigator. Both features could leverage services like Firecrawl to handle complex web content extraction, JavaScript-rendered pages, and provide reliable search results (https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/search) that can be processed and integrated into conversations.

**YouTube Content Enhancement:**
Expand YouTube downloader capabilities in Life Navigator to support entire channels, automatic downloading of new videos, and subscription monitoring functionality. This would allow users to efficiently manage and access YouTube content within their knowledge workflow.

**Enhanced Guide Mode with General Obsidian Support:**
Expand the Guide mode capabilities to help users resolve general Obsidian issues by scanning and incorporating knowledge from the broader Obsidian knowledge base. This would enable the Guide mode to assist with common Obsidian problems, plugin conflicts, workflow optimization, and general troubleshooting beyond just Life Navigator-specific guidance. Includes investigating useful resources like Notion import processes (https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content) and other common Obsidian workflows that users frequently need help with.

**In-Chat Error Handling:**
Replace popup notifications with in-chat error messages for better user experience and context preservation. When API key errors, authentication failures, or other system errors occur, display them as special error messages directly in the chat interface instead of disruptive popup notifications. This would keep error information accessible within the conversation context, allow users to reference errors while troubleshooting, and maintain a smoother conversational flow without interrupting the user's workflow.

**Tool Architecture Review:**
Investigate whether any other tools should be migrated to user tools to improve plugin architecture and user customization capabilities. This would involve reviewing the current tool system to identify tools that could benefit from being user-configurable rather than built-in, potentially improving flexibility and allowing users to better customize their Life Navigator experience.

**Weekly and Monthly Note Support:**
Introduce support for weekly and monthly summaries via `ln-monthly-note` and `ln-weekly-note` link expansions, following the standards from the periodic notes plugin. This would extend the existing daily note functionality to support broader time periods, allowing users to access and reference their weekly and monthly notes directly within Life Navigator conversations for better long-term planning and reflection.

**System Prompt Context in TTS:**
Implement system prompt injection into TTS prompt via current chat expansion so that the entire system prompt will be included in the context of text-to-speech generation. This would ensure that the AI's voice responses maintain consistency with the current mode's personality, instructions, and context, providing a more coherent and contextually aware audio experience that aligns with the written conversation flow and system configuration.

**Obsidian Link Support in AI-Generated Text:**
Add support for Obsidian's `[[]]` link syntax in AI-generated text and update analyst prompts to use this syntax. This would enable the AI to create proper internal links when generating content, making the output more integrated with Obsidian's linking system and allowing users to navigate seamlessly between AI-generated content and their existing notes.

**Eleven Labs Audio Generation Prototype:**
Develop a prototype for generating audio content using Eleven Labs' text-to-speech capabilities within Life Navigator. This would explore advanced voice synthesis options, potentially offering more natural-sounding speech, voice customization, and enhanced audio quality compared to current TTS solutions. The prototype would evaluate integration feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and user experience improvements for audio-based interactions.

**Document Collaboration:**
Enable document sharing with collaborative editing capabilities, allowing multiple users to check off todos, add notes, and see updates in real-time. This would enhance team productivity and coordination, though technical feasibility within Obsidian's architecture needs to be evaluated.
