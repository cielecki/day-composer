# Mode Development Guide

**Complete guide for creating, customizing, and validating Life Navigator modes**

This guide covers everything you need to know about developing AI personalities (modes) for Life Navigator, from basic customization to advanced mode creation.

## What Are Modes?

Life Navigator modes are AI personalities with specific expertise, communication styles, and capabilities. Each mode is designed for particular use cases:

- **Assistant**: Professional task management and organization
- **Planner**: Strategic daily planning and goal setting  
- **Reflection**: Personal insights and pattern recognition
- **Tool Creator**: Technical development assistance
- **Bro**: Motivational coaching and direct advice

## Mode File Structure

Every mode is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing configuration and a body containing the system prompt.

### Basic Template

```markdown
---
tags:
  - ln-mode
ln_icon: brain
ln_icon_color: "#4ade80"
ln_description: Brief description of what this mode does
ln_model: auto
ln_thinking_budget_tokens: 1024
ln_max_tokens: 4096
ln_voice_autoplay: true
ln_voice: alloy
ln_voice_instructions: How the AI should speak when using voice
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "*"
ln_tools_disallowed: []
ln_example_usages:
  - "Example message to trigger this mode"

## Advanced Mode Features

### Context Integration

Modes can reference user information through link expansion:

```markdown
## Your Context Awareness

You have access to the user's personal information through these links:
- [[About Me]] ðŸ§­ - Core personal details and goals
- [[ln-day-note-(0)]] ðŸ§­ - Today's activities and plans
- [[Relationships]] ðŸ§­ - Important people in the user's life

Always consider this context when providing advice and recommendations.
```

### Dynamic Tool Filtering

Create specialized tool access for different modes:

```yaml
# Research mode - focus on information gathering
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "vault_*"
  - "library_*"
  - "note_create"
  - "note_modify"
ln_tools_disallowed:
  - "task_*"
  - "note_delete"
```

### Multi-Language Support

Create modes in different languages:

```yaml
# Spanish mode example
ln_description: Asistente personal en espaÃ±ol para planificaciÃ³n diaria
ln_voice_instructions: |-
  Habla en espaÃ±ol con un tono amigable y profesional.
  Usa vocabulario claro y estructuras gramaticales correctas.
```

## Mode Validation & Testing

### Using the Mode Validator

Always validate your modes before using them:

1. **Run Validation**: Use the Mode Validator tool in Life Navigator
2. **Check Results**: Review any errors or warnings
3. **Fix Issues**: Address configuration problems
4. **Re-validate**: Test until validation passes

### Common Validation Errors

**Invalid YAML Syntax:**
```yaml
# Wrong - missing quotes around colon
ln_description: This: breaks YAML parsing

# Correct - proper quoting
ln_description: "This: works correctly"
```

**Missing Required Fields:**
```yaml
# Missing ln_description and ln_icon
tags:
  - ln-mode
ln_model: auto
```

**Invalid Icon Names:**
```yaml
# Wrong - not a valid Lucide icon
ln_icon: not-a-real-icon

# Correct - valid Lucide icon
ln_icon: brain
```

**Invalid Tool Patterns:**
```yaml
# Wrong - invalid wildcard pattern
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "task*"

# Correct - proper wildcard syntax
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "task_*"
```

### Testing Your Mode

1. **Basic Functionality**: Can the mode respond appropriately?
2. **Tool Access**: Does it have the right tools available?
3. **Voice Output**: Does the voice match the intended personality?
4. **Context Usage**: Does it properly use linked information?
5. **Edge Cases**: How does it handle unusual requests?

## Common Mode Patterns

### Task-Focused Mode
```yaml
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "task_*"
  - "note_*"
  - "vault_search"
ln_tools_disallowed:
  - "note_delete"
ln_description: Focused on task management and productivity
```

### Creative Mode
```yaml
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "note_*"
  - "library_*"
  - "vault_*"
ln_tools_disallowed:
  - "task_*"
  - "*delete*"
ln_description: Creative writing and ideation assistant
```

### Analytical Mode
```yaml
ln_thinking_budget_tokens: 4096
ln_max_tokens: 8192
ln_tools_allowed:
  - "vault_*"
  - "library_*"
  - "note_create"
ln_description: Deep analysis and research assistant
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Mode Not Appearing
- Check that file has `ln-mode` tag
- Verify file is in correct location
- Restart Life Navigator if needed

### Voice Not Working
- Confirm voice name is valid (`alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `shimmer`)
- Check voice instructions are properly formatted
- Verify text-to-speech is enabled in settings

### Tools Not Available
- Validate tool patterns in `ln_tools_allowed`
- Check for conflicts in `ln_tools_disallowed`
- Verify tool names are correct

### Poor Response Quality
- Increase `ln_thinking_budget_tokens` for complex tasks
- Review system prompt clarity and specificity
- Test with different model settings

### Context Not Loading
- Verify link syntax: `[[Page Name]] ðŸ§­`
- Check that linked files exist
- Ensure `ln_expand_links` is `true` (default)

## Best Practices Summary

### DO:
- Validate modes before sharing or using extensively
- Use clear, specific system prompts
- Test voice settings with actual audio output
- Create focused modes with specific purposes
- Include relevant context links
- Use appropriate tool filtering
- Document your modes with clear descriptions

### DON'T:
- Create modes without validation
- Use overly complex or conflicting tool rules
- Make system prompts too vague or too restrictive
- Ignore voice instruction quality
- Give modes access to tools they don't need
- Forget to test modes with real scenarios
