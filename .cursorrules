When making changes to the code:
- After performing fixes also modify CHANGELOG.md (add to unreleased section), TODO.md (check off done tasks), .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG (add or create the commit message) and genearal documentation in docs/
- Plan and investigate the implementation first before writing code
- Remove any entries to the translation files that are no longer needed
- If you made any changes to the starter kit bump the starter kit version in main.ts


If asked to release a new version:
- node scripts/version.js X.X.X
- update the CHANGELOG.md (unreleased -> X.X.X + new empty unreleased section)


To regenerate starter kit data:
node scripts/generate-starter-kit.mjs
