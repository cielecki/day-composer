When making changes to the code:
- After performing fixes also modify CHANGELOG.md (add to unreleased section), TODO.md (check off done tasks), COMMIT.md (add or create the commit message to git) and genearal documentation in docs/. Note that changelog and commit is cumulative so dont replace content there - add stuff.
- Plan and investigate the implementation first before writing code, always seek aproval of the plan from the user
- Remove any entries to the translation files that are no longer needed
- If you made any changes to the starter kit bump the starter kit version in main.ts
- Avoid code duplication, create reusable functions and components

If asked to release a new version:
- node scripts/version.js X.X.X
- update the CHANGELOG.md (unreleased -> X.X.X + new empty unreleased section)
