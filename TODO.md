# TODO

## Stages
- [x] Onboard 5 people to the plugin
- [ ] https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/6517
- [ ] Plan for promotion
- [ ] Create an onboarding video in english
- [ ] Start promoting the plugin on obsidian channels
- [ ] Communication: I'm not gathering data therfore I need your engagement and activelly telling me feedback and stories how your onboarding went, how you use it.

## Promo
- [ ] Write a draft blog post for people to read through and give feedback on
- [ ] ðŸ“ˆ Develop marketing concept "All you need is markdown" - emphasizing that Life Navigator doesn't need a database
- [ ] Article about wiki paradigm as markdown database (creating/using input output not chats and rag, AI helping with this)

## Nice to haves
- [ ] What happens if I write a string when there supposed to be an integer etc in modes frontmatter?
- [ ] Better info dumped to AI when file is not found in expand links
- [ ] ðŸ”§ Add author information to Life Navigator system prompts or ui dialogs - social media, support options, where to follow
    What's worth adding to prompts:
    - Social media: LinkedIn (@mielecki), X.com (@mcielecki), GitHub (@cielecki)
    - Discord Life Navigator community (invitation link)
    - How to support the project: GitHub stars, contributions, feedback, testing
    - Who I am: CEO 10Clouds â†’ indie open source creator, AI enthusiast
    - Life Navigator is open source, privacy-first personal AI companion
    - Project website link (when ready)
    - Encourage sharing the project with others
    - Ability to report bugs and feature requests on GitHub
- [ ] Review all the materials and docs and update them
