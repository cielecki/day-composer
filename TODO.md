# TODO

# Fixes

- [ ] **AI-Assisted Knowledge Base Editing:** Explore functionality for the AI to directly suggest or make additions/modifications to the user's core knowledge files (e.g., `About Me.md`, `Relationships.md`) based on conversations or insights. The user need is to streamline the process of updating personal context, allowing the AI to help maintain and expand the knowledge base it uses.

- [ ] **Interactive Creator Mode:** How to create guidance for users when creating their materials? Some nice mode? or docs? Maybe a tutorial agent? Create a creator mode that generates sections/files based on dialogue with the user instead of using standard starter kits. This would provide a more personalized and interactive setup experience.

- [ ] Generate image and other tools are missing translations and perhaps have too much progress reporting.

- [ ] action buttons placement for text + tool call blocks is not good.
- [ ] when I open a tool call that will get a navigation target I can no longer close it.

# Stages
- [ ] Onboard 5 people to the plugin
- [ ] Plan for promotion
- [ ] Create an onboarding video in english
- [ ] Start promoting the plugin on obsidian channels

# Promo
- [ ] Write a draft blog post for people to read through and give feedback on
- [ ] ðŸ“ˆ Develop marketing concept "All you need is markdown" - emphasizing that Life Navigator doesn't need a database
- [ ] Article about wiki paradigm as markdown database (creating/using input output not chats and rag, AI helping with this)

## Nice to haves
- [ ] System prompt injection into TTS prompt via current chat expansion? also refactor the way current chat information is gathered.
- [ ] Better info dumped to AI when file is not found in expand links- [ ] still there is something wrong with the current spot logic - is it still a problem?
- [ ] Create tool documentation in README or MODE_GUIDE or smth
- [ ] ðŸ”§ No action buttons on text messages ending with a tool call?
- [ ] Do I want the input buttons to be flat?
- [ ] Import z notion: https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content lub https://anytype.io
