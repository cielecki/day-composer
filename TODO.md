# TODO

# Fixes

- [ ] **Interactive Creator Mode:** How to create guidance for users when creating their materials? Some nice mode? or docs? Maybe a tutorial agent? Create a creator mode that generates sections/files based on dialogue with the user instead of using standard starter kits. This would provide a more personalized and interactive setup experience.

- [ ] **AI-Assisted Knowledge Base Editing:** Explore functionality for the AI to directly suggest or make additions/modifications to the user's core knowledge files (e.g., `About Me.md`, `Relationships.md`) based on conversations or insights. The user need is to streamline the process of updating personal context, allowing the AI to help maintain and expand the knowledge base it uses.

- [ ] **User-Defined Tools:** Introduce the ability for the user to add extra tools to the system. Investigate methods for loading extra tools (e.g., eval, JSON, MCP). This could allow accessing calendar for example.

- [ ] Tools Tools for searching the directories maybe like listing files on searching for files. This would enable having prompts AI. This kind of logic where OK every file with a given tag or every file in the given directory is something that you may pull into the context if based on name, it seems interesting. Also actually those listing queries could pass the front matter and extract and some attribute that provides usage so when given files should be added to the context and then adding it to the context, so I can choose based on this content of this attribute.

- [ ] System prompt injection into TTS prompt via current chat expansion? also refactor the way current chat information is gathered.

# Stages
- [ ] Onboard 5 people to the plugin
- [ ] Plan for promotion
- [ ] Create an onboarding video in english
- [ ] Start promoting the plugin on obsidian channels

# Promo
- [ ] Write a draft blog post for people to read through and give feedback on
- [ ] ðŸ“ˆ Develop marketing concept "All you need is markdown" - emphasizing that Life Navigator doesn't need a database
- [ ] Article about wiki paradigm as markdown database (creating/using input output not chats and rag, AI helping with this)

## Nice to haves
- [ ] Better info dumped to AI when file is not found in expand links- [ ] still there is something wrong with the current spot logic - is it still a problem?
- [ ] Create tool documentation in README or MODE_GUIDE or smth
- [ ] ðŸ”§ No action buttons on text messages ending with a tool call?
- [ ] Do I want the input buttons to be flat?
- [ ] Import z notion: https://www.notion.com/help/export-your-content lub https://anytype.io
